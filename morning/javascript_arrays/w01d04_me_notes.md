## INTRO (5 minutes)

`screen music`

**Navigate to the WDI_EUCALYPTUS_KOALA folder on your personal computer**

If you have any outstanding files that need to be tracked and committed, do that now.

**What:**
We will get practice using arrays, array methods and loops.<br>
**Why:**
As a developer using loops to control the flow of your program is important.<br>
**How:** We will investigate documentation to learn about array methods and practice using loops and nested arrays. <br>

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES (SWBAT)
1. Explain what `pop()`, `push()`, and `shift()` does.
2. Practice working with the JavaScript primitive datatype—arrays—and control flow structures—loops.

## I DO—Demo (5 minutes)
- Share link to documentation. Mention how docs can be helpful in exploring new territory and experimentation
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

## YOU DO—Read (5 Minutes)
- Have students take a short time to read through some of the methods available to arrays

## I DO—Exercise Explanation (5 Minutes)
- From the WDI_EUCALYPTUS_KOALA directory, `git pull upstream master`
- read through prompt slowly and carefully for clarity

## YOU DO—Arrays All Day (25 minutes)
- Check in after 15 minutes

## WE DO—Solve Arrays All Day (10 minutes)
– Show solution or code it live (will need to copy + paste part 3)
- Answer any clarifying questions about array methods
- Demo some array methods live if needed

## CLOSURE (5 minutes)
- Ask someone to explain `pop()`, `shift()` and `push()`
- Field any questions

## STAND UPS (10 minutes)

## Break. (10 minutes)
